## `SafeMath`



Math operations with safety checks that throw on error


### `mul(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Multiplies two numbers, throws on overflow.

### `div(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Integer division of two numbers, truncating the quotient.

### `sub(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Subtracts two numbers, throws on overflow (i.e. if subtrahend is greater than minuend).

### `add(uint256 a, uint256 b) → uint256` (internal)



Adds two numbers, throws on overflow.
